# Pollen Improvement Proposals (PIP)
The goal of the PIP project is to provide clear documentation for proposed changes and improvements to the Pollen Mobile ecosystem. 

When submitting a PIP, please use the <a href="https://github.com/pollen-mobile/PIP/blob/main/0000/pip-template.md">**Pollen Improvement Proposal Template**</a>. 

Visit <a href="https://discord.gg/FzyzADdj">#pip-general in the Pollen community Discord</a> if you have any questions or feedback on this process. 

## Submitting a PIP
1. Vet your idea with the Pollen community on Discord. 
2. Write up a structured and detailed proposal using the PIP template and submit it as a pull request to this repository (pollen-mobile/pip).

How to submit a pull request:

1. Fork this repository using the "Fork" button in the top-right and checkout your fork
2. Add your file using the next available number in the existing filename convention, e.g. 0001-anti-gaming.md
3. Commit your changes (git commit [filename] -m "Description of your changes") and push them to your fork (git push origin master)
4. Submit your change as a pull request

## Implementation Process
After you've submitted your PR, a member of the Pollen team will review your request for logistical or structural issues. Assuming no issues, your PR will be merged and your PIP will be opened up for full consideration. If there are issues, you will receive feedback. 

One your PR is merged, a channel for your PIP will be created in the Pollen Mobile community Discord (e.g. #pip-00-proposal-name)
